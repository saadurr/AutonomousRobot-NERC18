# AutonomousRobot-NERC18
Program in C for an autonomous robot which can localize itself in a given arena.

An Autonomous Indigenous Robot was designed and Programmed for a national level competition (NERC 2018).

- Programmed in C, based on Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3. The robot could localize itself in a given arena.
- The robot was able to sense obstacles, place objects, follow walls, and follow lines.
- Color sensor (TCS3200), SONAR sensor (HC-SR04) and IR sensors were interfaced with Arduino Mega 2560.
- DC stepper motors were used with Arduino Mega to design the ball potting mechanism.
